// Define the `Authorization` class.
export default class Authorization {
    // Define a static method called `handleUser`.
    static handleUser = ([event, ...args]: [event: string, ...args: any], next: (e?: any) => void, socket: Socket) => {
        // This method takes three parameters:
        // 1. An array containing an event name and additional arguments.
        // 2. A callback function called `next`, which may accept an error (`e`) as an argument.
        // 3. A `socket` object from socket.io.

        // Inside this method, you would typically check the user's permissions or perform some form of user authorization.
        // The commented line suggests that the authorization process might involve checking an authorization header.

        // Uncomment the following line to log the authorization header (if needed):
        // console.log(socket.request.headers.authorization)

        // After handling the user authorization, you call the `next` function to indicate that the authorization process is complete.
        // If there's an error during authorization, you can pass the error as an argument to `next`.
        // If authorization is successful, you can call `next` without any arguments.

        // For example:
        // next(); // Successful authorization
        // or
        // next(new Error("Unauthorized")); // Authorization failed
    }
}
